@NPDebs - based on our retro we'd like to start implementing a project management board for web tasks, so it's easy to see what is highest priority. Please have a think about a good way to start making priorities and live tasks clearer: https://github.com/features/issues 

Also happy to chat on this if you're not sure where to start!

@Melleason reported that guard.io reports we-are-ols.org is a malicious site. 

A quick google suggests that there's a good chance guard.io uses "scareware" tactics to get money from people, so I think there's a chance the alert is false - but I'd like to double check we don't have any obvious vulnerabilities too.

https://we-are-ols.org/open-incubator/fiscal-hosting/ isn't easily found from the incubator page, and https://we-are-ols.org/open-incubator.html#fiscal-hosting makes it easy to thinkg it doesn't exist.

Is there a systematic way to fix this? or do we just want to make sure we change the link and remove the placeholder? 

Other examples:

:PRIORITY: P2
:END:

*Description:*
A favicon is a crucial element for a website's visual branding and recognition. It appears in the browser tab or bookmark bar and helps users easily identify the site.
*Request:*
I kindly request adding a favicon to the OLS website for all pages.
[[https://github.com/open-life-science/open-life-science.github.io/assets/45734838/fb0fcbd1-a849-476f-b6be-76b212ecd46f]]

*Favicon Image:*
i will use this OLS Logo 
<img src="https://github.com/open-life-science/open-life-science.github.io/assets/45734838/5aafa202-40c9-4f1c-b77a-aa04e621cacf" alt="logo without full name" width="300" height="auto" />  | or this | <img src="https://github.com/open-life-science/open-life-science.github.io/assets/45734838/d2f61382-cba3-446e-8969-233cdb46c538" alt="open seeds logo full" width="300" height="auto" />

*Implementation:*
The favicon can be added by modifying the website's HTML layout file (e.g., =_layouts/base.html=) to include the favicon link tag in the head section.

*Consistency:*
Having a favicon across all pages will maintain visual consistency.

*Benefits:*
- Improved visual branding and recognition
- Enhances professionalism and user experience

Right now all our maps show scales from 0-N, which makes it a little hard to determine which countries OLS has light presence in. 

Example here: https://openlifesci.org/ols-stats/community/explore_location.html 

Could we have a version of the map that has one colour for 0/null (white or gray maybe) and another colour for "any participants at all"? I think this would more clearly show our international diversity.

:END:

This issue exists to provide a progress update and detail the ongoing efforts to add Nebula to the website.

*Changes so far:*
- Add 'nebula' sub-folder to _data directory.
- Reproduce the folder structure currently in _data/openseeds.

```
    _data
          /openseeds
                ...
          /nebula
                /neb-1
                      metadata.yaml
                      projects.yaml
                      schedule.yaml
                /neb-2
                ...
```

Commits related to the sub-site creation can be found on [[https://github.com/NPDebs/open-life-science.github.io/tree/add_nebula][this branch]] of my fork.

*To be done:*
- The =people.yaml= file is to be updated using a csv file from Civi.
- The other =*.yaml= files are to be populated from the Nebula planning sheet.
- Extracting data from the said planning sheet would require modification of the existing scripts.

*OBSERVED BEHAVIOUR*

The newly created [[https://openlifesci.org/links][QR page]]  containing important links for OLS looks good on desktop. However, it is not very responsive on mobile. Some texts are spilling out of their containers, as seen in the image below.

[[https://github.com/open-life-science/open-life-science.github.io/assets/105166953/888674cf-0d1e-4538-bbce-ed66fbab62cb]]

*EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR:*
Make page responsive, with content occupying appropriate width and height.

*ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:*
- The layout for this page is found [[https://github.com/open-life-science/open-life-science.github.io/blob/main/_layouts/links.html][here]].
- The styling for this page is located [[https://github.com/open-life-science/open-life-science.github.io/blob/8dcdbe359c4fe6eb89b702b544074a3e6f8eb087/css/custom.scss#L431][here]]  in this [[https://github.com/open-life-science/open-life-science.github.io/blob/main/css/custom.scss][stylesheet]].

*Observed behaviour:*
Currently, the [[https://openlifesci.org/openseeds/][open seeds program]] is described as being targeted at people interested in applying *open principles* in their work..." This boldly highlights a term but does not provide any further information for individuals seeking more context.

Fortunately, the *Open seeds paper* summarises these concepts. As such, the goal of this issue is to call for the paper to be made more prominent on the website. 

*Expected behaviour:*
- Create a new page (=/about/open-science=).
- Explain the Open Principles.
- Highlight the Open Seeds Paper.
- Possibly, link to other useful resources (videos, articles, etc).

Would this work? 

1. Get accepted project NAME + mentors onto the website. 
2. Civi: Registration form: make sure that mentees have a separate form from mentors and facilitators. 
3. FOR MENTEES: The project name becomes a dropdown in Civi. 
4. At this point, all people who have registered against a given project are added to the website. 

Source of truth: Always the website. 

- [ ] First cohort call: check if everything is correct. 
- [ ] Again at midpoint and final survey.

- oop / library outside this web repo
- might be a good way for debs to get library prep / oop experience? 

this is not immediately critical; it's forward looking for maintainability.

people will change their project name over time - this is fine! But if they register as =MyAwesomeProjectDotCom= at the start, and graduate as =AwesomeProj=, it's hard to guess who it is sometimes and make sure our internal knowledge management is consistent. 

What can we do to make this easier for us?

I've gone through OLS-8 and changed the naming to be consistent. Previously we had 

- OLS-8, week X: title of call
- OLS8 - week X - title
- OLS8, week X - title

etc.

I don't mind WHICH format we use, but a consistent one would be nice!

following on from open-life-science/open-life-science.github.io#815, we've noticed that sometimes group composition for projects - and project names - change over the course of a cohort. That's fine and normal! But we should have a process to handle it and make things less confusing. 

Suggestion: in the mid- and post- cohort surveys, ask the following question: 
"Is the entry on the OLS website correct for your project? Does it show all the group members and the correct title?" Or something similar.

we've had a scenario where people registered in Civi for an OLS cohort, but weren't on the site. It looks like they registered late, so they weren't in the project spreadsheet. 

Title, keywords, description - comes from original application. 
Mentors, participant names. 

people yaml - comes from civi
projects yaml come from the applications spreadsheet. 

One option - require ORCIDs for application? GitHub? Other? 
Alternatively, a civi dropdown with all the accepted projects in one cohort - is that a thing?
